						<tr class="COLUMNns2"><td colspan="2">The <b>Keyword</b> search field is a powerful tool that can help you find the exact jobs you are looking for.
						<br><br>
						You can search jobs for a single word or a phrase.   
							Keyword searches effectively search as though a 
							wildcard were appended to each search term. Thus a 
							keyword search for <b>engineer</b> also finds 
							engineering, engineered, engineers. Keyword searches will find jobs 
							that contain matching words or phrases in any searchable job field including job title, job description, etc.
						<br><br>
						Avoid using quotes or punctuation such as commas.
						</td></tr>
						<tr><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td></tr>
						<tr class="COLUMNns2">

							<td colspan="2">
								You can use boolean operators in the Keyword field to get more specific search results. 
								These searches do an "exact match" search. That 
								is, a boolean search for <b>asp OR engineer</b> 
								finds only those exact forms of the two words. 
								Use the * wildcard with search terms in boolean 
								searches if you want other forms of the words 
								considered in your results. Searching for <b>asp 
								OR engineer*</b> will include engineering, 
								engineered, engineers, etc, just as searching 
								for <b>engineer</b> would.<p>Please note that non-English users must still use the English boolean operators. 
								For example, if you are performing a boolean search in French, you cannot type "Unix ET NT", you must type "Unix AND NT".
